# Challenge 1

Challenge one asks you to build out the rest of a terrible version of chat GPT. You can ask any question to this chatbot, but it won't know the answer. Instead, it will just give you back a random fact about cats (see `catFactsClient.js` for help on getting the cat facts). Add the following pieces of functionality:

1. As the user types their question, the "question mirror" portion of the screen should update with exactly what they are typing as they type it.
2. When the user submits their question, the UI should update with a random cat fact.
3. When the user presses the clear button, their question should be deleted from the text input.

If implemented properly, all unit tests for the component should pass. Then you are done!

To get started, run `npm start` in one terminal window (this should open up the app automatically in your web browser) and `npm test` in another to see the skipped unit tests.
